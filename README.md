# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 🩺💻

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data.

## 🔍 Overview

The model is trained on health-related features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- And more...

## 📊 Algorithm Used

- Logistic Regression  
> (Other algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes will be added soon!)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle:  
[Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## 📈 Results

The model achieved good accuracy and can assist in early detection of heart disease risks.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- VS Code
